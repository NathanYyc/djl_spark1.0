# Pose estimation example

Pose estimation is a computer vision technique for determining the pose of an object in an image.

In this example, you learn how to implement inference code with a [ModelZoo model](../../docs/model-zoo.md) to detect dogs in an image.

The source code can be found at [PoseEstimation.java](https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl/blob/master/examples/src/main/java/ai/djl/examples/inference/PoseEstimation.java).

## Setup guide

Follow [setup](../../docs/development/setup.md) to configure your development environment.

## Run pose estimation example

### Input image file
You can find the image used in this example in the project test resource folder: `src/test/resources/pose_soccer.jpg`

![soccer](../src/test/resources/pose_soccer.png)

### Build the project and run
Use the following command to run the project:

```
cd examples
./gradlew run -Dmain=ai.djl.examples.inference.PoseEstimation
```

Your output should look like the following:

```text

```

An output image with the detected joints will be saved as build/output/joints.png:

![joints](img/joints.png)
